# Custom-Churn-Prediction# Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning - First Attempt

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This is my first attempt at predicting customer churn using a **Deep Learning model** built with **TensorFlow & Keras**. The dataset used is **Churn_Modelling.csv**, and the goal is to classify whether a customer will exit (churn) or stay with the bank.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Highlights:
- Built a **Sequential Neural Network** with **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Achieved **~80% accuracy**
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding & Feature Scaling**
- Used **ReLU & Sigmoid activations**
- Trained for **100 epochs**

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Information
The dataset consists of customer details, such as **Geography, Gender, Credit Score, Balance, etc.**

### ðŸ”‘ Features Used:
| Feature Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **CreditScore** | Customer's credit score |
| **Geography** | Country of residence |
| **Gender** | Male/Female |
| **Age** | Customer's age |
| **Tenure** | Years of account ownership |
| **Balance** | Account balance |
| **NumOfProducts** | Number of bank products used |
| **HasCrCard** | Whether the customer has a credit card |
| **IsActiveMember** | Whether the customer is active |
| **EstimatedSalary** | Estimated salary |

### ðŸŽ¯ Target Variable:
- `Exited` (1 = Churn, 0 = No Churn)

## ðŸ”¨ Model Architecture
```python
# Build the neural network
model = Sequential([
    Input(shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dense(3, activation='relu'),
    Dense(11, activation='relu'),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

### **Hyperparameters**
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
- **Epochs**: 100
- **Validation Split**: 20%

---

## ðŸ“Š Results & Observations
- **Accuracy on Test Set:** ~80%
- **Validation Accuracy fluctuated** across epochs
- The model could be **further optimized** by adjusting layers, neurons, and hyperparameters.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
âœ… **Hyperparameter Tuning** (Neurons, Layers, Regularization, Dropout)
âœ… **Reduce Overfitting** (Better architecture)
âœ… **Increase Accuracy** (Aim for 85-90%)

## ðŸ“œ Learning Takeaways
ðŸ“Œ Neural networks **require careful tuning** to improve performance.
ðŸ“Œ **Feature scaling & encoding** are crucial for better training.
ðŸ“Œ **Churn prediction** can benefit from additional feature engineering.
